\begin{abstract}
Since its development, the car has had a huge economic and social influence. It has created industries and caused others to crumble. The popularity of the auto-mobile has had an impact on city planning due to its effects on employment, trade, manufacture and even basic social interaction.

As the popularity of these vehicles in both a private and public context has increased, transport planners and civil engineers have had to adjust our road networks accordingly often through the development of mathematical models for traffic flow (of varying accuracy).

This project is our attempt at producing a software  package that shows the effects of changes to pre-existing networks (i.e. increase/decrease in demand, adding lanes, changing existing lanes into bus lanes) on the overall flow. The primary output will be data that can be fed into an appropriate statistical package for professional analysis.
